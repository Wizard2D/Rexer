# Rexer
Rexer is a simple regex lexer library that helps you do lexical analysis more easily.
It's a very small and documented library, so using it shouldn't be hard.
The library doesn't use any other packages that don't come from the .NET library already.

An example of usage is available in the ``RexerTests`` folder.

# How to Get?

You can get the library from the NuGet page at ``https://www.nuget.org/packages/Rexer/1.0.0`` or you can build it yourself(refer to the ``How to Build`` section.)
On Visual Studio you aswell may use ``Install-Package Rexer``

# How to Build?

Clone the repository to a folder of choice with ``git clone https://github.com/Wizard2D/Rexer.git``.

`` With Visual Studio ``
Open the project in Visual Studio(2019 needed.) then build it with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd> or by pressing the ``Build`` button in the Project tab or by rightclicking on the project in the explorer.

`` With the dotnet CLI ``
Navigate to your folder in the terminal, then run ``dotnet build`` and it should be compiled in your bin/... folder.

# How to Contribute?

To contribute you should first of all do the first step in the ``How to Build`` section.
Then open the project in VS and modify the files that you want to modify.
Afterwards do the rest of the ``How to Build`` section.
Then if everything works well open a pull request in the github.

# Got an issue?
Feel free to open a new issue on the github, and it should get reviewed fairly quickly.
