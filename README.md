# Rexer
Rexer is a simple regex lexer library that helps you do lexical analysis more easily.
It's a very small and documented library, so using it shouldn't be hard.
The library doesn't use any other packages that don't come from the .NET library already.

An example of usage is available in the ``RexerTests`` folder.
